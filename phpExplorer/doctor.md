myself.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I've got to do is pass as an 
ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful? '!

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary 
human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the 
Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

1. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, 
the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm the Doctor. Well, 
they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm nobody's taxi 
service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so 
don't lie to me! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me 
the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's 
aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. The way I see it, every life is a pile of 
good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the 
bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I've 
got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse 
than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
